Added to `/etc/rc.local` to turn off the ACT led for system operations:

```
# Set the Pi Zero ACT LED trigger to 'none'.
echo none | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

# Turn off the Pi Zero ACT LED.
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

nohup su pi -c 'python -u /home/pi/lapse_project/lapse.py &'
```

The nohup command runs the timelapse script after the Pi has booted.

Other experiment scripts are just to experiment with python and the Pi.


# Make a file with all the image filenames
# This one gets all the images from the top of the hour
ls -1v lapse_<timestamp>/*00-00* | grep jpg > files-4-3-2017.txt

# Stich the photos together with mencoder
# scale should be the size of the images
time mencoder -nosound -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=21600000 -o out24fpshourly-4-3-2017.avi -mf type=jpeg:fps=24 mf://@files-4-3-2017.txt -vf scale=3280:2464
