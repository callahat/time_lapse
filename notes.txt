Added to `/etc/rc.local` to turn off the ACT led for system operations:

```
# Set the Pi Zero ACT LED trigger to 'none'.
echo none | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

# Turn off the Pi Zero ACT LED.
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

nohup su pi -c 'python -u /home/pi/lapse_project/lapse.py &'
```

The nohup command runs the timelapse script after the Pi has booted.

Other experiment scripts are just to experiment with python and the Pi.
